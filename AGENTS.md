# AGENTS.md — Production Kotlin/Android Contract

Production Kotlin/Android repository. Make the smallest correct change preserving architecture, user data, security, lifecycle, compatibility, and release behavior.

Default bias: **inspect first; one owner/truth; explicit source/cache/projection, async/lifecycle/duplicate semantics, contracts, and proof.**

Do not add dependencies, plugins, modules, wrappers, caches, layers, generated code, or runtime services unless materially required and no simpler repository-compatible pattern exists.

**Kotlin size gate:** target ≤500 handwritten lines. Before materially exceeding ~500, look for a real ownership/cohesion split; exceed only when splitting adds coupling/wiring or the extra size is clearly low-risk, and record why. New files normally stay ≤500.

Repository evidence/instructions win; use proportional judgment for trivial work.

**Research gate:** before implementing any feature or behavior change, read official docs/source for the exact versions involved and search GitHub for relevant implementations, issues, regressions, and edge cases. Use that evidence to choose logic/architecture; repository contracts and official sources win. Never cargo-cult third-party code or architecture.

## Project golden rule

**Simple, functioning, efficient, stable code. Simpler, maintainable architecture.**

Avoid over-engineering, unnecessary abstractions, duplicated ownership, hidden state, fragile workarounds, leaks, loops, races, and unnecessary complexity.

## Operating behavior

### Think before coding

**Do not assume or hide ambiguity.**

Before implementing:
- State material assumptions. Ask before choices affecting data loss, security, money, identity/authorization, irreversible behavior, public contracts, retention, or major UX.
- For reversible low-risk ambiguity, choose the smallest compatible behavior and record it.
- Surface simpler tradeoffs; never invent backend guarantees, authorization/conflict/retention policy, or destructive behavior.

### Simplicity first

**Minimum code; nothing speculative.**

- No unrequested features, one-use abstractions, or speculative configurability.
- Do not defend states impossible by types/invariants. Treat persisted/platform/IPC/network/route/file/SDK boundaries as fallible and map failures at their owner.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

### Surgical changes

**Touch only what the request requires.**

- Do not improve adjacent code, comments, formatting, or architecture.
- Match existing style. Mention unrelated dead code; do not remove it.
- Remove only imports/variables/functions made unused by your change.
- Every changed line must trace to the request.

### Goal-driven execution

Turn work into verifiable goals: reproduce a bug before fixing it, test invalid inputs before adding validation, and preserve before/after behavior during refactors. For defects, find the first bad state/root cause at its owner; never mask it with arbitrary delay/retry/refresh/reset, broad catch, suppression, or stacked guards unless that mechanism is itself justified by the operation semantics and evidence.

For multi-step work, state `step -> verification` briefly and loop until defined checks pass. Weak goals such as “make it work” require clarification.

## Product contract gate

For non-trivial features/apps, use `android-product-contract` before implementation. Resolve goal/non-goals/journeys; owners/truth; data/auth/account lifecycle; online/offline/conflict; mutation duplicate/retry/undo/unknown outcomes; restoration/permissions/security/privacy/platform constraints; external guarantees; acceptance/forbidden outcomes. Convert vague requirements to observable scenarios; separate policy from mechanism; record low-risk assumptions.

## 1. Always-on invariants

These apply even to small fixes:

1. **One authority per mutable fact.** Name who may decide and mutate it.
2. **Truth differs from source, cache, and UI state.** Server may be upstream authority, Room local truth, and ViewModel a projection.
3. **Every async operation has semantics:** latest-wins, first-wins, single-flight, queue, merge, idempotent retry, or concurrent.
4. **Every operation has a lifecycle owner** and intentional stop/survive/transfer behavior.
5. **Every mutation defines duplicate/retry behavior** across taps, re-collection, retries, and recreation.
6. **Every cache defines key, owner, freshness, identity scope, invalidation, and removal.**
7. **Every boundary maps models/errors deliberately;** transport, DB, framework, and sensitive details do not leak upward.
8. **UI renders state and emits actions;** it owns no repository/API/DAO/DataStore/durable work/business truth.
9. **Navigation is a host/UI-edge effect;** data/domain layers never navigate.
10. **Compilation is not proof.** Run a focused `android-post-change-audit` after implementation; verify wiring, behavior, races, lifecycle, and contracts proportional to risk.
11. **Every edit classifies persistence impact before implementation.** Check Room entities/DAOs/database, DataStore, files, serialized backups, and other durable contracts. If Room schema could change, inspect the current DB version, exported schema history, migration chain, and every production builder before editing. A schema change requires a complete non-destructive upgrade path; a non-schema change must not bump the DB version merely for ceremony.

If an invariant is unclear, inspect rather than inventing a convenient owner.

## 2. Instruction and skill use

**Hard pre-edit gate:** before modifying any repository file, read root `project.md`, `architecture.md`, every matching `.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md`, then the target file and enough direct callers/callees/tests/wiring to identify the live owner. Search for an existing owner/helper/pattern before creating one. Do not edit until dependency direction, invariants, production path, and persistence impact are understood; ambiguity means inspect, not guess.

For conflicts prefer: user-data/security safety; repository architecture/versions; lifecycle/cancellation/retry/recreation correctness; smaller verifiable changes; fewer assumptions/dependencies.

Never let a specialist skill silently trigger a broad migration. Version-specific or experimental guidance applies only when the project already uses that stack or the user explicitly requested the migration.

### Living project documentation

`project.md` and `architecture.md` are implementation contracts. Update `project.md` for verified repository/toolchain/build/schema/integration fact changes; update `architecture.md` for ownership, truth, dependency, lifecycle/concurrency, persistence, navigation, DI, background-work, or enforcement changes. For non-trivial patches, record why unchanged. Code/wiring beats stale prose; exclude secrets, local paths, transient status, and speculative plans. See `android-architecture-ownership`.

## 3. Authority, truth, and source model

Distinguish these before changing behavior:

| Concept | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical authority | Decides facts and accepts/rejects mutations | server record, local-only Room table, DataStore setting |
| Upstream source | External producer; may or may not be authoritative | REST API, SDK callback, system provider |
| Local truth | Observable local record rendered by the app | Room query, DataStore Flow, session holder |
| Cache | Discardable acceleration copy | memory/disk response or image cache |
| Projection | Derived read-only representation | `UiState`, filtered/formatted data, badge count |
| Pending intent/outbox | Durable unconfirmed mutation | sync queue, pending upload row |
| System truth | Android/other-process state | permission, connectivity, notification setting |

Multiple sources are valid; multiple undecided authorities are not. Divergence requires reconciliation, freshness, conflict, and pending-write policy.

### Required owner map

For non-trivial work, resolve:

```text
Feature/operation; product policy owner
Canonical authority; observable local truth; upstream sources
Projection/state owner; mutation owner; freshness/refresh owner
Cache owner/key/scope/invalidation; identity/account/tenant owner
Lifecycle owner; concurrency semantics; navigation owner
Dependency construction owner; test oracle
```

Rules:
- ViewModel may own screen state, not durable authority.
- In offline-first flows, an API response is not committed truth until the local transaction succeeds.
- Memory is not truth merely because it is fast.
- Repository owns source/reconciliation strategy; UI never chooses API versus DB.
- Recompute derived values from their owner or invalidate them with it; do not synchronize duplicate copies manually.
- Include account, tenant, locale, permission, environment, and feature-flag context in keys/invalidation when relevant.
- Optimistic writes model pending/confirmed/failed/rollback/retry; do not claim permanent success before authoritative outcome unless policy accepts it.
- If remote success precedes local persistence failure, retain reconciliation evidence.
- Treat time as a dependency for expiry/order/backoff/freshness/date boundaries; use the project clock when available.

### Source strategy must be explicit

Choose and preserve one read strategy: local-only, online-only, network-first with defined fallback, cache-first with freshness/invalidation, or offline-first with local truth, transactional refresh, and pending/conflict policy. Room alone does not make a design offline-first.

## 4. Lifecycle and scope model

Every reference, collector, listener, coroutine, cache, and worker has a scope owner and termination rule.

| Owner | Appropriate work | Must not retain |
|---|---|---|
| Composition | composition-bound UI effects | Activity/View beyond composition; durable work |
| Fragment view lifecycle | binding, collectors, adapters/listeners | view after `onDestroyView` |
| Activity lifecycle | results, permissions, system UI | feature work that should survive recreation without transfer |
| ViewModel | screen state/cancellable operations | Activity, Fragment, View, NavController, UI-lifetime Context |
| Repository/app scope | explicitly shared process work | UI references, unbounded per-screen collectors |
| WorkManager | durable, deferrable, retryable, constrained work | navigation, screen state, unsafe non-idempotent retry |

Rules:
- Use structured concurrency; parent owns child cancellation/completion.
- Collect UI state/effects only while the relevant lifecycle is active.
- Register/unregister callbacks in the same owner; cleanup on cancellation and disposal.
- Never retain views, Compose lambdas, Activity contexts, adapters, or callbacks in longer-lived objects.
- Configuration recreation is not process survival. Use `SavedStateHandle`, durable storage, or authoritative reload by importance; save stable IDs/minimal reconstructible input, not large/domain objects.
- Transfer work that must outlive the screen to an app owner or WorkManager. Do not lengthen scope for work that should stop on leave.
- Logout/account switch cancels or invalidates scoped work, collectors, caches, pending UI state, and credentials.
- Process initialization is idempotent; avoid duplicate observers/work from multiple entry points.

Test affected lifecycle boundaries: leave/return, recreate, background/foreground, cancel, account switch, or process restore.

## 5. Concurrency and operation semantics

Choose semantics per operation:

| Operation | Typical default | Protection |
|---|---|---|
| Changing-input read/search | latest-wins | cancel/ignore obsolete completion |
| Manual refresh | single-flight or latest-wins | de-duplicate; define stale display |
| Submit/payment/order/upload | first-wins or queue | guard duplicates; idempotency key when supported |
| Toggle/favorite | serialize per entity or coalesce final intent | reconcile failures |
| Pagination append | one in-flight per key/direction | prevent duplicate pages/key races |
| Background sync | idempotent retry/merge | unique work, transactions/checkpoints, bounded retry |
| Independent reads | concurrent | intentional aggregation/partial-failure policy |

Rules:
- Prior-state updates are atomic.
- Cancellation blocks obsolete UI commits, but does not prove a remote write did not happen.
- Use operation IDs/generations when the source cannot cancel or callbacks may arrive late.
- Serialize at the narrowest key; avoid global locks for unrelated work and locks across remote I/O unless required.
- Multi-write DB invariants use transactions. Cross-process/server invariants use constraints, unique work, idempotency, or server enforcement—not an in-process mutex.
- Multiple collectors must not trigger accidental refreshes/mutations; Flow temperature, sharing scope, and replay are deliberate.
- Retry only bounded transient, idempotent, or protected work. A write timeout may be unknown outcome; reconcile before dangerous retry.
- Backpressure is explicit; never silently drop business-critical events through conflation/replay/buffer overflow.

### Mandatory race audit

```text
Double tap/repeated action; older read after newer read
Refresh vs pagination/mutation; screen destroyed before completion
Account/tenant change in-flight; worker retry after partial success
Remote success before local commit failure; duplicate collectors/entry points
Cancellation between side effect and state update; freshness boundary change
```

Use the smallest mechanism proving the semantics; do not stack guards without distinct reasons.

## 6. Execution protocol

For non-trivial changes:

1. **Resolve contract:** observable acceptance, forbidden outcomes, invariants, assumptions, external guarantees.
2. **Inspect:** modules/source sets, DI, navigation, state/events, persistence, network, errors, tests, build conventions, versions.
3. **Map owners:** policy, authority, local truth, sources, projection, mutation, freshness, cache, lifecycle, concurrency, navigation, dependency, tests.
4. **Define states:** success/loading/empty/error/retry/cancel/stale/offline/duplicate/permission/recreation as relevant.
5. **Patch the nearest owning seam;** do not route around it from UI or create a parallel owner.
6. **Preserve/migrate contracts:** find affected producers/consumers before changing routes/deep links, schemas/serialized fields/DTOs, exported components, APIs, Gradle coordinates, or user-visible behavior.
7. **Implement minimally** with existing DI, dispatchers, mappers, errors, and tests.
8. **Verify the risk** using deterministic tests and real boundaries where fakes could hide defects.
9. **Audit final diff** with `android-post-change-audit`: production reachability/bindings, obsolete parallel paths, owners, logic, stale/duplicate work, loops, cleanup/leaks, data/security, variants, complexity.
10. **Fix and re-audit narrowly;** no speculative cleanup.
11. **Report facts:** findings, changed files, exact checks, unrun checks, residual risk.

Audit after code/resource/manifest/schema/build/dependency/config changes; documentation-only work may use diff-only audit. Debug from evidence, not trial-and-error.

## 7. Architecture boundaries

Default direction:

```text
UI -> ViewModel -> Repository -> Room/API/DataStore/File
```

Use a UseCase/Interactor/Service only for shared business policy, multi-repository orchestration, complex validation/calculation, transaction-like workflow, or a valuable test seam. A class that only forwards one call is noise.

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| Composable/View UI | rendering, UI-local mechanics, actions, semantics | API/DAO/DataStore calls, durable truth, business mutation, long-lived cache |
| Activity/Fragment | hosting, lifecycle, result/permission launchers, system integration | normal feature business rules, retained view references |
| ViewModel | immutable screen state, actions, validation, screen async, UI-safe errors/effects | Activity/Fragment/View/NavController, DAO/API details, durable cache truth |
| Repository | source strategy, freshness, mapping, mutation semantics, offline/conflict policy | screen state, navigation, UI strings/components, lifecycle references |
| DAO/API/DataSource | boundary mechanics and transport/storage contracts | screen policy, navigation, cross-feature orchestration |
| Worker | durable idempotent work, constraints, progress/retry | navigation, screen state, unsafe repeated mutation |

Preserve safe existing architecture; never force a pattern/framework because a skill mentions it. Dependency construction stays in the existing DI/composition root; do not bypass it from UI/ViewModel.

## 8. State, events, and navigation

- Expose immutable state; keep mutable state private.
- Model exclusive modes so impossible state combinations cannot occur.
- Durable outcomes belong in durable/replayable state or source of truth. Event streams are for transient presentation effects.
- No in-memory event stream guarantees exactly-once delivery across process death.
- Navigation executes at the UI/host edge. ViewModels may expose typed intents/state, but never hold UI/navigation framework objects.
- Pass stable IDs/minimal arguments and reload from the owner after recreation.
- Validate deep links and route arguments; re-check authentication/authorization at the destination.
- Prevent duplicate destinations when repeated actions are possible.
- Permission and Activity Result launchers stay at the UI edge; ViewModel owns decision and result state.
- UI loading state is not a concurrency protocol; the mutation owner protects duplicate execution.

## 9. Coroutines, Flow, and background work

- No `GlobalScope`, unmanaged scope/thread, main-thread blocking, or orphan job.
- Scope work to composition/lifecycle, `viewModelScope`, an explicitly owned app/repository scope, or WorkManager.
- The boundary performing blocking I/O owns dispatcher switching. Avoid redundant `Dispatchers.IO` around main-safe Room/Retrofit suspend APIs.
- Never swallow `CancellationException`. `runCatching` in suspend paths must preserve cancellation.
- Use `async` only for true concurrency and always await/aggregate. Choose `coroutineScope` versus `supervisorScope` by failure semantics.
- Callback streams use cancellation-aware bridges and unregister reliably.
- Choose Flow operators by semantics: latest for cancellable reads, not ambiguous writes; `combine` for latest values; `zip` for pairwise values.
- Define `stateIn/shareIn` scope, start policy, replay, and stop behavior deliberately.
- Avoid per-collector refresh/mutation unless explicitly intended.
- WorkManager jobs are idempotent, constrained, uniquely named where duplication matters, and persist checkpoints required for safe retry.

## 10. Data, cache, sync, Room, and Paging

Every repository read/write path defines:

```text
Authority and observable truth
Read strategy and freshness
Write/commit path
Offline and stale behavior
Refresh trigger and de-duplication
Conflict and pending-write policy
Retry/idempotency
Cache key/scope/invalidation
Account/logout behavior
```
- Use Room as observable local truth when the product/repository requires it, not as a reflex for transient online-only data.
- Separate DTO, Entity, Domain, and UI models when contracts differ; map explicitly at boundaries.
- Atomic multi-write invariants use DAO `@Transaction` or `RoomDatabase.withTransaction`.
- Never use destructive migration for user data without explicit approval; migration changes require tests.
- Avoid N+1 queries, unbounded reads, missing hot-path indexes, per-collector refresh, and replace-all logic that destroys pending edits.
- Store relational/list data in a database, small preferences/config in DataStore, and secrets in approved secure storage.
- Cache keys include every result dimension and identity context. Invalidate on logout/account/tenant/environment changes.
- Sync records pending/failed/deleted/conflicted state as required; never silently discard local edits.
- Paging has one owner for load keys and in-flight direction; UI handles load states and retry without launching duplicate loads.
- Commit one visible local state in one DB transaction. Across remote/local boundaries, define commit order, idempotency, pending intent/outbox when needed, and reconciliation; network I/O and a local transaction are never one atomic commit.

### Persistence/schema gate

Classify persistence impact for every edit. If Room schema is unchanged, do not bump the DB version or create ceremonial migrations. If it changes, follow the **Destination-specific Room schema evolution gate** in `android-data-room-sync-paging`: shipped schema JSON/history is immutable; increment `N -> N+1` once; add a contiguous deterministic local migration preserving user rows (no network/session-dependent/destructive fallback); export/review the new schema; register every production builder; test fresh creation, direct `N -> N+1`, and retained/shipped-origin -> current upgrades on a real Room boundary with representative data/constraints plus affected DAO read/write; define downgrade/rollback/forward-fix behavior. If emulator/device migration proof was not run, report it unverified.

## 11. Network, authentication, and errors

- Centralize base URL, serialization, timeouts, auth headers, safe logging, and token refresh in existing network infrastructure.
- Token refresh is single-flight, avoids recursive interceptor loops, and invalidates the session cleanly when impossible.
- Map transport/status/serialization errors to stable domain failures at the data boundary. Raw exceptions and DTOs do not leak to UI.
- Preserve cancellation and distinguish unknown outcomes for timed-out writes.
- Retry only bounded transient/idempotent or protected operations; respect server hints.
- Validate unknown enum values, nullability, pagination, clocks/time zones, and backward-compatible fields.
- Never log bodies, headers, tokens, cookies, credentials, personal/payment data, or unredacted identifiers.
- Client state never becomes authority for payment, entitlement, identity, integrity, or privileged access; server verification owns those decisions.

## 12. Compose, views, UX, and accessibility

- UI renders state and emits actions; no repository/API/DB work from composition or view callbacks beyond dispatching actions.
- Keep business state in ViewModel and ephemeral mechanics in `remember`/`rememberSaveable` or view-local state.
- Collect state/effects with lifecycle awareness; choose effect keys intentionally and clean listeners/resources.
- Never write state during composition or perform expensive transforms in hot composition/list item paths.
- Public reusable composables accept `Modifier`; leaf components do not receive ViewModels.
- Lazy lists use stable keys where identity survives reorder.
- Preserve the design system; support font scaling, RTL, long text, keyboard/focus, semantics, target sizes, and gesture alternatives.
- Use real insets, not fixed status/navigation bar approximations; avoid double consumption.
- Test loading, empty, error, disabled, large-text, IME, resize/fold, and edge-to-edge states when affected.

## 13. Security, privacy, storage, and platform boundaries

- Treat manifests, exported components, intents/deep links, PendingIntents, providers/URI grants, WebViews, notifications, clipboard, backups, telemetry, and screenshots as exposure boundaries.
- Export only when required; validate caller/input and enforce permission/authentication at the receiving boundary.
- Prefer explicit intents; sanitize incoming URIs/actions/extras. Never trust client-provided authorization decisions.
- PendingIntent mutability is minimal and explicit; immutable by default.
- Use content URIs/FileProvider and narrow temporary grants; never expose raw paths.
- Restrict WebView JavaScript/file access/mixed content/redirects/bridges unless required and reviewed.
- Secure storage protects secrets at rest; it does not make the client authoritative.
- Request least privilege at point of need and handle denial, permanent denial, settings changes, and degraded behavior.
- UI messages are safe/localized; never expose stack traces, raw server bodies, SQL, paths, tokens, or internal identifiers.

## 14. Build, DI, performance, and release

- Preserve existing catalog, plugins, repositories, DI framework/scopes, module boundaries, toolchain, and generated-code approach. No incidental AGP/Gradle/Kotlin/Compose/KSP/SDK/Navigation/Room/billing upgrades.
- DI follows lifecycle; no UI object in singleton scope, duplicate binding, hidden service locator, or manual construction around the graph.
- Never disable lint/tests/shrinking/warnings/security checks globally to pass a build, and never place secrets in source/resources/manifest/catalog/Gradle/BuildConfig expecting secrecy.
- Measure before optimizing. Verify affected variants/release/minified behavior when reflection, serialization, schemas, navigation, background work, SDKs, or packaging changed; keep R8 rules narrow and preserve shipped mappings.
- For material release risk, use `android-gradle-di-release`/`android-performance-release` to define compatible rollout, intervention signals, rollback/disable or forward-fix behavior. Do not call rollback safe across irreversible schema/server/data-format changes without evidence.

## 15. Tests and debugging

Every behavior-changing feature, logic change, or bug fix must assess the ten-test matrix below. Applicable rows require automated proof; `N/A` requires a structural reason; unavailable device/infrastructure is `UNVERIFIED`. One test may cover multiple rows. Pure docs/copy/build-metadata edits are exempt.

```text
1 Core logic: rules, boundaries, invalid/conflicting inputs, outputs.
2 State transitions: relevant inverse, permission, and expiry transitions.
3 Happy-path E2E: real trigger/UI -> owners -> persistence/platform -> observed result.
4 Persistence/process death: recreate from durable truth, not memory.
5 Failure/recovery: break the key dependency, fail safely, then recover.
6 Cross-feature: meaningful collision points only.
7 Concurrency/duplicates: rapid/repeated/overlapping work obeys declared semantics.
8 UI behavior: controls, validation, loading/error, navigation/restoration reflect truth.
9 Lifecycle/reboot: mandatory for system-owned features; ordinary CRUD may be N/A with reason.
10 Regression: every fixed behavior bug gets a permanent reproducer test.
```

Use the cheapest faithful unit/coroutine/ViewModel/Room/worker/UI/instrumentation/release boundary. Tests must fail when the defect/invariant breaks; never weaken tests or gates to turn green. See `android-testing-debugging` for the detailed matrix and `android-post-change-audit` for enforcement.

## 16. Anti-pattern radar

Reject or isolate these unless a documented legacy constraint requires them:

| Hazard | Safer direction |
|---|---|
| UI calls DAO/API/DataStore | action -> ViewModel -> repository |
| repository/use case navigates | typed result/state -> UI host |
| duplicate mutable copies of same fact | one authority + derived projections |
| API response and Room both treated as truth | explicit source strategy and commit order |
| public mutable Flow/LiveData/list | private mutable owner + immutable view |
| Boolean “navigate once” flag | durable state or lifecycle-aware transient effect |
| `GlobalScope` / unmanaged scope | explicit lifecycle owner or WorkManager |
| broad catch swallows cancellation | specific handling; rethrow cancellation |
| `flatMapLatest` for unsafe write | queue/single-flight/idempotency protocol |
| refresh per collector/recomposition | refresh owner + de-duplication |
| mutable singleton cache | scoped cache with key/TTL/invalidation |
| optimistic success without reconciliation | pending/confirmed/failed protocol |
| mutex assumed to protect server/process invariant | DB/server/idempotency/unique-work enforcement |
| destructive Room migration | explicit migration + test |
| raw exception/server text in UI/log | safe mapping and redaction |
| broad R8 keep rules | minimal rules + minified verification |
| fake success after failure | explicit error/stale/pending state |

## 17. Completion checklist

Before finishing:

```text
[ ] Acceptance/forbidden outcomes, assumptions, owners, source strategy, and stable contracts are explicit.
[ ] No parallel truth/global mutable owner/UI data access/data-layer navigation or unnecessary abstraction/upgrade was added.
[ ] Cancellation, stale completion, duplicate/retry/partial outcomes, lifecycle/recreation/account behavior are safe where relevant.
[ ] Persistence/schema, Room migration chain/builders, permissions, privacy, exported boundaries, logging, and UI-safe errors were checked.
[ ] Touched handwritten Kotlin files stay around ≤500 lines, or the cohesion/low-risk reason for exceeding it is recorded.
[ ] `project.md` / `architecture.md` were updated when impacted, or the audit records why not.
[ ] Focused tests/checks target the failure mechanism; unrun checks are named.
[ ] `android-post-change-audit` checked final wiring, logic/races/loops, cleanup/leaks, data/security, release boundaries, and complexity.
[ ] Final diff contains no unrelated cleanup, debug code, secrets, generated noise, suppressions, or accidental contract changes.
```

## 18. Proof-of-change protocol

Complete only when evidence shows intended behavior changed, protected behavior did not, and no material audit finding remains. Compilation is necessary, not sufficient.

Before implementation identify outcome/non-goals; authority/source/commit path; lifecycle/concurrency/duplicate semantics; stable contracts and data/security/release risks; and evidence that could disprove correctness. Preserve a defect reproducer/test/trace/state sequence when practical.

Verification layers, proportional to risk:
1. **Static:** final diff, production reachability/bindings and stale old paths, owner/dependency changes, API/schema/route/manifest changes, visibility/nullability, generated files, suppressions, secrets.
2. **Deterministic:** success plus plausible failure, cancellation, stale/duplicate action, retry/partial outcome, restoration.
3. **Boundary:** real serializer/DB/worker/navigation/permission/framework boundary where a fake could hide the defect.
4. **Lifecycle/adversarial:** recreation/backgrounding/multiple collectors/rapid input/network loss/account switch/timeout or unknown write.
5. **Variant/release:** affected flavors/build types, minified release, API/platform and packaging where relevant.

Evidence must fail if the defect returns and verify protected invariants. Report changed behavior; owner/source path; concurrency/lifecycle result; preserved contracts; exact/adversarial/unrun checks; operational readiness when material; residual risk. Never claim fully verified/production-ready/fixed when material checks were not run or proof is compilation-only.
